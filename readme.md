# Spam filter with Naive Bayes

This mini-project demonstrates a spam filter using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Using the [SMS Spam collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection) dataset , we implement the algorithm to classify the messages as spam or ham (not-spam). This project is an extension of the similar project shared by [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-projects-for-beginners-with-source-code/#project13).

Essentially we calculate word frequencies, prior probabilities, and conditional probabilities to make predictions.

### Tools used
- Python programming language
- Jupyter notebook environment
- pandas 

The Jupyter notebook "Spam_Filter.ipynb" contains all the codes and the results. It is thoroughly commented and self-explanatory.
