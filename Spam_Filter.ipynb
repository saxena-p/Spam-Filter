    "# Building a spam filter with Naive Bayes algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by *Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo*, and it can be downloaded from the The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is based on and extends a similar project shared by [DataQuest](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission433Solutions.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **pandas** to manipluate the data and **re** for working with text."
